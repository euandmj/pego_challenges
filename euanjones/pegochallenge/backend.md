# Bookstore
This assignment is composed by 2 parts:
 1. A design challenge
 2. A code challenge

## How to start
Fork this repo so we can start tracking.

## Deadline
There's no deadline, do it in your own time.

## 1 - The Design Challenge
Design a simple bookstore app: sketch out a high level architectural design and considerations for a global bookstore application (i.e. web site / mobile application).
The application must support the use case of book browsing/search, shopping cart, payment and shipping.

Layout the technology (multi-tiered) and solutions to meet the requirements of the principles:
 - Scalability: world-wide access
 - Reliability: handling the user mistakes, thwarting unauthorized access
 - Availability: always on
 - Performance: high performing with low latency and response time, and high throughput
 - Maintainability: easy to maintain and operate

Remember we're looking for a high level and simple design and this should take no more than 2 hours, therefore, focus on aspects that you believe to be most important.

### Design deliverable
A hand drawn or digital diagram and brief outline of your designs and why you chose them.
Please make it readable and state any assumptions you have made.
Commit your design to the forked repo.

## 2 - The Code Challenge
Pick one (and only one) service from your bookstore design and develop it in C# to a working state that can be demonstrated.
It can be from any part of the system, and as small as you want, just enough to showcase how you structure it and your coding skills.
Beyond this requirement, it's up to you to make your own choices, e.g., tech stack, data source, type of interfacing, etc.

### How to deliver your code challenge
After fork, commit your changes in a way that we can clearly evaluate the development process, and don't forget to add a README to help us to understand your project and build it, run it and test it =)
